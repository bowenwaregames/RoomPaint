# Room-Paint
Simple application which takes the dimensions of a room and outputs the Area, volume and
paint needed to paint the walls. This was created for the borwell software challenge.

Consists of 3 projects.
- RoomPaint
- SimpleRoomPaint
- UnitTests

SimpleRoomPaint is a simple console application which you can build and run.

# Building

This requires .Net Core 1.1 or above.

To build the solution in Visual Studio, simply open `RoomPaint.sln` and
go to Build -> Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)

I used Visual Studio 2017 to build this application.

# Tests

To run the unit tests in Visual Studio go to Test -> Run -> All Tests. Or this can be done from
the Test Explorer.
